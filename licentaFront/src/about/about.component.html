        The research explores how decentralized technologies and swarm intelligence—specifically Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)—can be used to improve energy consumption efficiency within smart grids.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with an Angular-based frontend, this project enables real-time optimization, transparency, and user participation in energy management.
